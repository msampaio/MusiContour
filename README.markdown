# MusiContour: musical contour relations calculator

#### by [Marcos da Silva Sampaio](http://marcosdisilva.net) and [Pedro Kröger](http://pedrokroger.net) [[Genos Research Group](http://genosmus.com)]

This is a software to calculate and plot musical contour relations
operations. MusiContour can process contour related to parameters such
as pitch, duration, dynamics and chord density. This software provides
Contour Theories operations (see below).

MusiContour had two names before its current one: Goiaba (2007), a
software developed to process musical contours, during Marcos da Silva
Sampaio [master's degree](http://marcosdisilva.net/en/research), and
Villa-Lobos Contour module, a module of Villa-Lobos, and is now
independent.

MusiContour is part of Marcos da Silva Sampaio PhD project about
musical contour relations. More information about these project is
available in its [page](http://genosmus.com/pesquisa/contornos), in
portuguese.

## Installation

The MusiContour's dependencies are listed in requirements.txt
file. Numpy must be installed before matplotlib.

I recommend to install MusiContour in a virtualenv and use pip:

    pip install numpy
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Then:

    python setup.py install
